We are an international community of native and non-native English speakers interested in building friendships and supporting families in the canton of Bern. We offer a weekly bern for pre-K children to develop their social skills with other children their age through free play, songs and snack time. We also provide an open environment for parents and caregivers to relax, enjoy their children and chat with other parents.
